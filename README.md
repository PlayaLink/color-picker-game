# color-picker-game

A simple game that teaches people how RGB color codes work.

The web app generates a RGB code and a grid of tiles with randomly assigned colors. You win the game by clicking on the tile whose color corresponds to the given RGB code.

The project uses CSS stylings and event listeners coded in vanilla JavaScript.
